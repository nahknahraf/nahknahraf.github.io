### HI THERE! I’M FARHAN. IF YOU WANT TO KNOW A BIT MORE ABOUT ME, READ ON!
My passion is using engineering to improve people’s lives, and giving people the tools they need to do the same.

I received my Bachelor’s degrees in Electronics from Mumbai University. During University, I co-founded and led Homerobotics.in, I led a team of engineers for designing and building electronics for Robocon and was the Electronics Head for Electronics Engineerng Students Association (EESA).

I have an insatiable passion for building things. I have designed prosthetic hands, home-automation systems, wearables, learning robots, and more.

When not building products, I love to teach. My written and video tutorials have been utilized by millions of people to learn electrical engineering and embedded software design. My book, Exploring Arduino, has been translated into multiple languages and is used as an engineering textbook around the world, including at my Alma Mater, Cornell.
